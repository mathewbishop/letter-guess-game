# letter-guess-game
This repo contains a simple letter guess game called "Hacker 2077." The objective of the game is for the user to guess a the correct letter, which is a randomly chosen letter from the english alphabet. The user has 10 guesses to get it right each round. If the user fails to guess the letter with the allotted guess, that counts as a 'loss' for that round. The user must win 3 rounds to win the game, or lose 4 rounds to lose the game. 

The game is set and themed in a cyberpunk world.
